   <h1>Live a life that you will appreciate looking back.</h1>
  <br>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p> is like sailing a boat. You first identify where you want to get to (making a decision), which is based on your judgement, and then you set sail in that direction (actually doing what you wanted to do), in which time there are winds that you must navigate (distractions).

If you do not reflect then your judgement will not improve, and if you are not present then you will not be able to fend off distractions and stick to what yo truely want to be doing. Given these two vital elements, the orgnisation has two parts
</p>
<h3>Circle Discussion</h3>
  <p>There is nothing wrong with making a mistake, but making repeated mistakes due to a lack of reflection is unfortunate. Hence this is the first element of the organisation, to create a consistent space in which you can reflect, learn from others.
<ol>
  <li>An excerpt of a book chosen by your group is the basis of the discussion.</li>
  <li>Share your learning and learn from others, an environment of intellectual curiosity.</li>
  <li>Share what you are proud of, or any issues you want a second opinion on. Most often just by saying the issue aloud you see the solution yourself.</li>
</ol>


Typically meets every one to two weeks.
</p>
<h3>Unity Breathing</h3>
  <p>Presence is neccessary for happiness - most people are shocked about how distracted they are upon starting Unity Breathing. Unity breathing is an effective way to strengthen your presence.
<ol>
  <li>Get a group, as well as a bell or something that sounds (or you can clap).</li>
  <li>Each person takes turns leading the breathing meditation. The leader signals "in" and "out" for the breaths and strikes the sound every 5 breaths.</li>
  <li>Every 20 breaths the leading gets passed on to the next person.</li>
</ol>

The longer you can do this the more present you are, and the happier you will be - it is that simple. Remember, though, that if you are starting at 10 minutes you should slowly increase this with your group - just like in the gym you can't go from 1 kg to 10 kg in a day.
